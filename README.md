### Project Description

This project is a basic idea of a Book Lending App, to let the user track which book they already read, or which they are reading and even which they want to read, this project was made using react and some more advanced techniques of react hooks and libraries, like styled-system to improve the way to create styles for the application, and custoom hooks to better modulate the project logic. 

The main Idea of this project is to apply some knowledges that I already had in react and to receive a feedback to improve the way I code in react.
